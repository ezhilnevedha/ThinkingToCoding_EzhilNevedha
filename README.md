### NAME: EZHIL NEVEDHA K

## LOGICAL SUMMARY:
This star-patterned program arranges the stars in a triangle pattern with the given number of stars.
After getting the input from the user, the code implements the star pattern based on the giveen input number.

## CODE SUMMARY:
INPUT: Firstly, the code starts with getting the input (as a number) from the user.
PROCESS:
-> After getting the input, variable 'i' is initialized with for loop.
-> Next, variable 'j' is initialized as a nested for loop within the first loop
-> In the next step, the required spaces are printed for the stars to be in equilibrium shaped.
-> Now, variable 'k' is initialized with for loop within the first loop in the range(1,2*i) which refers to the * to be printed
-> The calculation goes as: (1,2), (2,4), (3,6)...
-> Then the output is printed.

## WHAT I LEARNT FROM THIS CODE:
From this code, I learnt to execute a star pattern using nested loops.
How the code especially works with nested loops.
