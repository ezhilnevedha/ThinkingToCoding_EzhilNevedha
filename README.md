## LOGICAL SUMMARY:
This star-patterned program arranges the stars in a triangle pattern with the given number of stars.
After getting the input from the user, the code implements the star pattern based on the giveen input number.

## CODE SUMMARY:
Input- Firstly, the user should provide all the 3 inputs like type of pattern, number of rows and the symbol to be printed. One cannot proceed without giving proper inputs otherwise error will be thrown. 
MongoDb connection- After this, by cliking generate, it connects to the MongoDB and then stores the input data. 
Output- After this, the output is generated and the data is stored in MongoDB.

## WHAT I LEARNT FROM THIS CODE:
From this code, I learnt how to create an app using Streamlit, how database connection is established to MongoDB, and how triangle concept and loops work.
And i have learnt to handle database connection error and fixed the real-world issues in the application.
